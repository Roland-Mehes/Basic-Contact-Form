# Contact Form

A simple and clean **Contact Form** built with just **HTML** and **CSS**.  
Nothing fancy — this is a minimal project to keep my frontend basics fresh and practice clean layout design.

## 🔧 Features
- Responsive layout (basic)  
- Semantic HTML5 structure  
- Simple and modern CSS styling  
- Easy to integrate into any project  

## 📁 Files
- `index.html` — The form structure  
- `style.css` — All the styling  

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser  
3. Customize as needed (e.g. add functionality with JavaScript or connect to a backend)  

## 💡 Note
This form is **static** and does **not** include any backend or JavaScript functionality.  
You can easily extend it with your preferred form handling method (e.g. PHP, Node.js, Formspree, etc.).
